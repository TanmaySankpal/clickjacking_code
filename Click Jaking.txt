Clickjacking is a type of cyber attack where an attacker tricks a user into clicking on a button or link on a website that performs an unintended action. The attacker overlays an invisible layer over the original website and makes it seem as though the user is clicking on something harmless. In reality, they are performing an action that is being controlled by the attacker, such as downloading malware or revealing sensitive information. This type of attack is a serious security risk and can cause harm to both individuals and organizations.
